# Govt. Scheme Recommendation System:
This project is a Streamlit web application that helps users find relevant government agricultural schemes based on their input queries. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity for recommendation.

## Features:
~ User-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit.
~ Takes a user query as input (e.g., "I am suffering from crop damage").
~ Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert scheme descriptions into numerical representations.
~ Finds and suggests the top N most similar schemes based on cosine similarity.

## Technologies Used:
~ Python
~ Scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity)
~ NLP (Natural Language Processing)
~ GitHub for version control

## Running the App:
**Start the Streamlit app using:**
~ streamlit run schemes.py
